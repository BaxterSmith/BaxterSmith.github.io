                <h3>Welcome!</h3>
                <p>Hi! I'm Baxter Smith, a 24-year-old student at General 
                Assembly's 12-week Web Development Immersive course in 
                Atlanta, Georgia. Hopefully, by the end of this 
                course, I'll land a position in a real web design/development 
                job!
                </p>

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I was born in 1994 in Atlanta, and I grew up in 
                Cincinnati, Ohio and Tampa, Florida. I attended Georgia 
                Perimeter College for three semesters before transferring 
                to Gwinnett Technical College for two years. I graduated in 
                April 2018 with an Associate's degree in Web Design/Development. 
                I currently live in the Atlanta area with my mom, stepdad, and 
                three dogs.
                </p>
